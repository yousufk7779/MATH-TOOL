    title: "Real Numbers",
    introduction: "We begin our study of numbers by revisiting the system of Real Numbers. Real numbers include all the rational numbers (like 1/2, 0, -5) and irrational numbers (like √2, π) that we can represent on a number line. In this chapter, we will deepen our understanding of these numbers through two important properties: the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic and the concept of Irrationality.",

    keyPoints: ["Every composite number can be written as a product of primes, and this decomposition is unique.","Irrational numbers are those which cannot be written in the form p/q.","If a number has a decimal expansion that is non-terminating and non-recurring, it is irrational.","HCF is the product of the smallest power of each common prime factor.","LCM is the product of the greatest power of each prime factor."],

    crux: ["This chapter explores the world of real numbers, focusing on integers, rational numbers, and irrational numbers. The core idea is to understand the fundamental building blocks of numbers through prime factorization and to rigorously prove why numbers like √2 and √3 cannot be expressed as simple fractions.","Two main pillars of this chapter are:","The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: Any composite number can be uniquely broken down into prime factors.","Revisiting Irrational Numbers: Using contradiction to prove a number is irrational."],
    summary: ["In this chapter, we learned that every composite number can be expressed as a product of primes in a unique way. We used this property to find the LCM and HCF of integers. We also proved that numbers like √2, √3 are irrational by assuming the opposite and finding a contradiction (that common factors exist where they shouldn't). Finally, we saw that the sum or product of a rational and irrational number is always irrational."],

    summary: ["The crux of this chapter lies in understanding the relationship between the algebraic representation and the geometric representation of lines.","1. Graphical Representation: If lines intersect at one point → Customary unique solution. If lines are parallel → No solution. If lines overlap exactly → Infinitely many solutions.","2. Algebraic Methods: Substitution Method: Solve for one variable and substitute it into the other equation. Elimination Method: Equalize coefficients to eliminate one variable by addition or subtraction. Cross-Multiplication Method: A direct formula-based approach (often optional but useful).","Mastering the conditions for consistency ({{frac}}a₁{{over}}a₂{{endfrac}}...) is critical for solving questions quickly without solving the entire system.","In this chapter, we explored the world of \"Pair of Linear Equations in Two Variables\". We learned that every linear equation in two variables represents a straight line on a Cartesian plane.","We discovered that a pair of such equations can behave in three ways: they intersect, they are parallel, or they coincide. We can predict this behavior simply by comparing the ratios of their coefficients {{frac}}a₁{{over}}a₂{{endfrac}}, {{frac}}b₁{{over}}b₂{{endfrac}}, and {{frac}}c₁{{over}}c₂{{endfrac}}.","Finally, we equipped ourselves with powerful algebraic tools—Substitution and Elimination—to find the exact values of variables, enabling us to solve a wide range of real-world problems involving ages, fractions, speed, and costs."],

Cartesian Plane: The plane formed by the intersection of two perpendicular number lines (x-axis and y-axis). Axes: The horizontal line is the x-axis, vertical is the y-axis. Origin: Intersection of axes, O(0, 0). Quadrants: Axes divide the plane into four quadrants (I, II, III, IV). Abscissa (x): Perpendicular distance from y-axis. Ordinate (y): Perpendicular distance from x-axis.",

    title: "Introduction to Trigonometry",
    introduction: "The word 'trigonometry' is derived from the Greek words 'tri' (meaning three), 'gon' (meaning sides) and 'metron' (meaning measure). In fact, trigonometry is the study of relationships between the sides and angles of a triangle. In this chapter, we will study some ratios of the sides of a right triangle with respect to its acute angles, called trigonometric ratios of the angle. We will restrict our discussion to acute angles only. Right-Angled Triangle: A triangle in which one angle is a right angle (90°). The side opposite to the right angle is called the Hypotenuse. The other two sides are often referred to as the Base (adjacent to the angle of interest) and the Perpendicular (opposite to the angle of interest).",

The values of the trigonometric ratios of an angle do not vary with the lengths of the sides of the triangle, if the angle remains the same.","2. Since the hypotenuse is the longest side in a right triangle, the value of sin A or cos A is always less than 1 (or, in particular, equal to 1).","3. The symbol sin A is used as an abbreviation for 'the sine of the angle A'. sin A is not the product of 'sin' and A. 'sin' separated from A has no meaning.","4. Pythagoras Theorem: In a right-angled triangle, square of Hypotenuse = sum of squares of other two sides (\\(H^2 = P^2 + B^2\\)).","Standard values for 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90°:","An equation involving trigonometric ratios of an angle is called a trigonometric identity."],

    title: "Some Applications of Trigonometry",
    introduction: "In the previous chapter, we studied trigonometric ratios. In this chapter, we will explore some ways in which trigonometry is used in the life around us. Trigonometry is one of the most ancient subjects studied by scholars all over the world. Astronomers used it to calculate distances from the Earth to the planets and stars. We will see how trigonometry is used to finding the heights and distances of various objects like towers, mountains, buildings, etc., without actually measuring them.",
    definitions: [],
    keyPoints: ["To solve problems involving heights and distances, we need to understand the following terms:","The angle of elevation of an object as viewed by an observer is the angle between the horizontal line and the line of sight.","If the observer moves towards the object (e.g., a tower), the angle of elevation increases.","If the observer moves away from the object, the angle of elevation decreases.","For the same height, if the distance is doubled, the angle of elevation decreases but does not become half.","The angle of depression of a point on the ground from the top of a tower is numerically equal to the angle of elevation of the top of the tower from that point on the ground (Alternate Interior Angles).","For a right-angled triangle with angle θ:","sin θ = Opposite Side / Hypotenuse","cos θ = Adjacent Side / Hypotenuse","tan θ = Opposite Side / Adjacent Side","Most problems in this chapter involve angles of 30°, 45°, and 60°. Memorize these values:","1. Read the problem carefully and draw a neat, labeled diagram. Represent the height (tower, building) by a vertical line and the distance by a horizontal line.","2. Mark the given angles of elevation or depression. Remember, angle of depression is marked with the horizontal line at the top.","3. Identify the right-angled triangle(s) formed.","4. Choose the appropriate trigonometric ratio (usually tan θ, sometimes sin θ or cos θ) that relates the known side to the unknown side.","5. Form an equation and solve for the unknown value."],

    introduction: "Circle: A circle is a collection of all points in a plane which are at a constant distance (radius) from a fixed point (center). Center: The fixed point from which all points on the circle are equidistant. Radius: The constant distance between the center and any point on the circle. Chord: A line segment joining any two points on the circumference of the circle. Diameter: The longest chord which passes through the center of the circle. Length of diameter is twice the radius (d = 2r). Secant: A line that intersects the circle at two distinct points. Tangent: A line that intersects the circle at exactly one point. This point is called the Point of Contact.",
