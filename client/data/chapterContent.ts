    crux: ["This chapter explores the world of real numbers, focusing on integers, rational numbers, and irrational\r\n            numbers.\r\n            The core idea is to understand the fundamental building blocks of numbers through prime factorization and to\r\n            rigorously prove why numbers like √2 and √3 cannot be expressed as simple fractions.","Two main pillars of this chapter are:","<b>The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:</b> Any composite number can be uniquely broken down into\r\n                prime factors.","<b>Revisiting Irrational Numbers:</b> Using contradiction to prove a number is irrational."],
    summary: ["In this chapter, we learned that every composite number can be expressed as a product of primes in a unique\r\n            way.\r\n            We used this property to find the LCM and HCF of integers.\r\n            We also proved that numbers like √2, √3 are irrational by assuming the opposite and finding a contradiction\r\n            (that common factors exist where they shouldn't).\r\n            Finally, we saw that the sum or product of a rational and irrational number is always irrational."],

    summary: ["In this chapter, we learned that the zeroes of a polynomial are the points where its graph cuts the x-axis.\r\n            We established that a quadratic polynomial has at most 2 zeroes.\r\n            Most importantly, we derived the relationship between the zeroes (roots) and the coefficients, allowing us\r\n            to build polynomials if we know their roots, or check the validity of roots without plugging them in\r\n            directly."],

    summary: ["In this chapter, we explored the world of \"Pair of Linear Equations in Two Variables\". We learned that every\r\n            linear equation in two variables represents a straight line on a Cartesian plane.","We discovered that a pair of such equations can behave in three ways: they intersect, they are parallel, or\r\n            they coincide.

Since the hypotenuse is the longest side in a right triangle, the value of <strong>sin\r\n                A</strong> or <strong>cos A</strong> is always less than 1 (or, in particular, equal to 1).","3. The symbol <strong>sin A</strong> is used as an abbreviation for 'the sine of the angle A'.\r\n            sin A is not the product of 'sin' and A. 'sin' separated from A has no meaning.","4. <strong>Pythagoras Theorem:</strong> In a right-angled triangle, square of Hypotenuse = sum\r\n            of squares of other two sides (\\(H^2 = P^2 + B^2\\)).","Standard values for 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90°:","<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"\r\n                style=\"width:100%; border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center;\">\r\n                <tr>\r\n                    <td>θ</td>\r\n                    <td>0°</td>\r\n                    <td>30°</td>\r\n                    <td>45°</td>\r\n                    <td>60°</td>\r\n                    <td>90°</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                    <td>sin A</td>\r\n                    <td>0</td>\r\n                    <td>1/2</td>\r\n                    <td>1/√2</td>\r\n                    <td>√3/2</td>\r\n                    <td>1</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                    <td>cos A</td>\r\n                    <td>1</td>\r\n                    <td>√3/2</td>\r\n                    <td>1/√2</td>\r\n                    <td>1/2</td>\r\n                    <td>0</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                    <td>tan A</td>\r\n                    <td>0</td>\r\n                    <td>1/√3</td>\r\n                    <td>1</td>\r\n                    <td>√3</td>\r\n                    <td>Not Defined</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                    <td>cosec A</td>\r\n                    <td>Not Defined</td>\r\n                    <td>2</td>\r\n                    <td>√2</td>\r\n                    <td>2/√3</td>\r\n                    <td>1</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                    <td>sec A</td>\r\n                    <td>1</td>\r\n                    <td>2/√3</td>\r\n                    <td>√2</td>\r\n                    <td>2</td>\r\n                    <td>Not Defined</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                    <td>cot A</td>\r\n                    <td>Not Defined</td>\r\n                    <td>√3</td>\r\n                    <td>1</td>\r\n                    <td>1/√3</td>\r\n                    <td>0</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n            </table>"],

    introduction: "In the previous chapter, we studied trigonometric ratios. In this chapter, we will explore\r\n            some ways in which trigonometry is used in the life around us. Trigonometry is one of the most ancient subjects studied by scholars all over the world.\r\n            Astronomers used it to calculate distances from the Earth to the planets and stars. We will see how trigonometry is used to finding the heights and distances of various objects\r\n            like towers, mountains, buildings, etc., without actually measuring them.",

In this chapter, we will explore\r\n            some ways in which trigonometry is used in the life around us.","Trigonometry is one of the most ancient subjects studied by scholars all over the world.\r\n            Astronomers used it to calculate distances from the Earth to the planets and stars.","We will see how trigonometry is used to finding the heights and distances of various objects\r\n            like towers, mountains, buildings, etc., without actually measuring them.","To solve problems involving heights and distances, we need to understand the following terms:","<strong>Line of Sight:</strong> The line drawn from the eye of an observer to the point in the object viewed\r\n            by the observer.","<strong>Horizontal Level:</strong> The line drawn horizontally through the eye of the observer.","<strong>Angle of Elevation:</strong> The angle formed by the line of sight with the horizontal when the\r\n            point being viewed is ABOVE the horizontal level (i.e., when we raise our head to look at the object).","<strong>Angle of Depression:</strong> The angle formed by the line of sight with the horizontal when the\r\n            point being viewed is BELOW the horizontal level (i.e., when we lower our head to look at the object).","The angle of elevation of an object as viewed by an observer is the angle between the horizontal line\r\n                and the line of sight.","If the observer moves towards the object (e.g., a tower), the angle of elevation increases.","If the observer moves away from the object, the angle of elevation decreases.","For the same height, if the distance is doubled, the angle of elevation decreases but does not become\r\n                half.","The angle of depression of a point on the ground from the top of a tower is numerically equal to the\r\n                angle of elevation of the top of the tower from that point on the ground (Alternate Interior Angles).","For a right-angled triangle with angle θ:","<strong>sin θ</strong> = Opposite Side / Hypotenuse","<strong>cos θ</strong> = Adjacent Side / Hypotenuse","<strong>tan θ</strong> = Opposite Side / Adjacent Side","Most problems in this chapter involve angles of 30°, 45°, and 60°. Memorize these values:","<strong>tan 30°</strong> = 1/√3 ≈ 0.577<br />\r\n            <strong>tan 45°</strong> = 1<br />\r\n            <strong>tan 60°</strong> = √3 ≈ 1.732","<strong>sin 30°</strong> = 1/2<br />\r\n            <strong>sin 45°</strong> = 1/√2<br />\r\n            <strong>sin 60°</strong> = √3/2","<strong>cos 30°</strong> = √3/2<br />\r\n            <strong>cos 45°</strong> = 1/√2<br />\r\n            <strong>cos 60°</strong> = 1/2","1. Read the problem carefully and draw a neat, labeled diagram. Represent the height (tower,\r\n            building) by a vertical line and the distance by a horizontal line.","2. Mark the given angles of elevation or depression. Remember, angle of depression is marked\r\n            with the horizontal line at the top.","3. Identify the right-angled triangle(s) formed.","4. Choose the appropriate trigonometric ratio (usually tan θ, sometimes sin θ or cos θ) that\r\n            relates the known side to the unknown side.","5. Form an equation and solve for the unknown value."],
