    introduction: "In Class IX, you explored the world of real numbers and encountered irrational numbers. In this chapter, we continue our discussion on real numbers with two very important properties of positive integers - Euclid's Division Algorithm and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. We will use these concepts to find HCF and LCM of numbers, prove the irrationality of numbers like √2, √3, √5, and explore when the decimal expansion of a rational number is terminating or non-terminating repeating.",
