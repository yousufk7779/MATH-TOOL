    introduction: "In Class IX, you explored the world of real numbers and encountered irrational numbers. In this chapter, we continue our discussion on real numbers with two very important properties of positive integers - Euclid's Division Algorithm and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. We will use these concepts to find HCF and LCM of numbers, prove the irrationality of numbers like √2, √3, √5, and explore when the decimal expansion of a rational number is terminating or non-terminating repeating.",

    introduction: "In Class IX, you studied polynomials in one variable and their degrees. In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between zeroes and coefficients of polynomials. You will learn how to find zeroes of quadratic polynomials and understand their geometrical meaning through graphs.\n\nThe zeroes of a polynomial are the values of the variable for which the polynomial equals zero. Understanding this relationship is crucial for solving equations and analyzing polynomial functions.",
