    introduction: "We begin our study of numbers by revisiting the system of Real Numbers. Real numbers include all the rational numbers (like 1/2, 0, -5) and irrational numbers (like √2, π) that we can represent on a number line. In this chapter, we will deepen our understanding of these numbers through two important properties: the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic and the concept of Irrationality.",

    keyPoints: ["We begin our study of numbers by revisiting the system of Real Numbers. Real numbers include all the rational numbers (like 1/2, 0, -5) and irrational numbers (like √2, π) that we can represent on a number line. In this chapter, we will deepen our understanding of these numbers through two important properties: the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic and the concept of Irrationality.","Every composite number can be written as a product of primes, and this decomposition is unique.","Irrational numbers are those which cannot be written in the form p/q.","If a number has a decimal expansion that is non-terminating and non-recurring, it is irrational.","HCF is the product of the smallest power of each common prime factor.","LCM is the product of the greatest power of each prime factor."],

    crux: ["This chapter explores the world of real numbers, focusing on integers, rational numbers, and irrational numbers. The core idea is to understand the fundamental building blocks of numbers through prime factorization and to rigorously prove why numbers like √2 and √3 cannot be expressed as simple fractions.","Two main pillars of this chapter are:","<b>The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:</b> Any composite number can be uniquely broken down into prime factors.","<b>Revisiting Irrational Numbers:</b> Using contradiction to prove a number is irrational."],
    summary: ["In this chapter, we learned that every composite number can be expressed as a product of primes in a unique way. We used this property to find the LCM and HCF of integers. We also proved that numbers like √2, √3 are irrational by assuming the opposite and finding a contradiction (that common factors exist where they shouldn't). Finally, we saw that the sum or product of a rational and irrational number is always irrational."],

    summary: ["In this chapter, we explored the world of \"Pair of Linear Equations in Two Variables\". We learned that every linear equation in two variables represents a straight line on a Cartesian plane.","We discovered that a pair of such equations can behave in three ways: they intersect, they are parallel, or they coincide. We can predict this behavior simply by comparing the ratios of their coefficients <span class=\"fraction\"><span class=\"numerator\">a₁</span><span class=\"denominator\">a₂</span></span>, <span class=\"fraction\"><span class=\"numerator\">b₁</span><span class=\"denominator\">b₂</span></span>, and <span class=\"fraction\"><span class=\"numerator\">c₁</span><span class=\"denominator\">c₂</span></span>.","Finally, we equipped ourselves with powerful algebraic tools—Substitution and Elimination—to find the exact values of variables, enabling us to solve a wide range of real-world problems involving ages, fractions, speed, and costs."],

    crux: ["The heart of this chapter is understanding that not all equations have real solutions, and we can predict this without solving the equation completely using the Discriminant.","<span class=\"bold\">1. Solving Methods:</span> <ul> <li><span class=\"bold\">Factorisation:</span> Best when the quadratic expression can be easily factored into (px + q)(rx + s). Ideally used when D is a perfect square.</li> <li><span class=\"bold\">Quadratic Formula:</span> The universal method. Works for any quadratic equation regardless of whether it's factorable or not.</li> <li><span class=\"bold\">Completing the Square:</span> Useful for deriving the quadratic formula and in geometric contexts, though less commonly used for quick solving.</li> </ul>","<span class=\"bold\">2. Word Problem Strategy:</span> <ul> <li>Identify the unknown quantity and let it be 'x'.</li> <li>Translate the given conditions into a mathematical equation involving x and usually its square (x²). </li> <li>Form the standard quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0.</li> <li>Solve for x and discard any values that don't make sense in context (e.g., negative length or age). </li> </ul>"],
    summary: ["In this chapter, we delved into Quadratic Equations, which are equations of the second degree. We started with the standard form <span class=\"bold\">ax² + bx + c = 0</span>.","We explored multiple ways to find the roots of these equations: by factorising into linear terms, by completing the square, and by using the powerful Quadratic Formula. We learned that a quadratic equation can have two distinct real roots, two equal real roots, or no real roots at all.","The key takeaway is the concept of the Discriminant (<span class=\"bold\">b² - 4ac</span>), which acts as a quick test to determine the nature of the roots without actually solving the equation. This chapter bridges the gap between simple linear relationships and more complex, curved relationships found in areas, physics, and optimization problems."],

    keyPoints: ["In the previous chapter, we studied trigonometric ratios. In this chapter, we will explore some ways in which trigonometry is used in the life around us.","Trigonometry is one of the most ancient subjects studied by scholars all over the world. Astronomers used it to calculate distances from the Earth to the planets and stars.","We will see how trigonometry is used to finding the heights and distances of various objects like towers, mountains, buildings, etc., without actually measuring them.","To solve problems involving heights and distances, we need to understand the following terms:","<strong>Line of Sight:</strong> The line drawn from the eye of an observer to the point in the object viewed by the observer.","<strong>Horizontal Level:</strong> The line drawn horizontally through the eye of the observer.","<strong>Angle of Elevation:</strong> The angle formed by the line of sight with the horizontal when the point being viewed is ABOVE the horizontal level (i.e., when we raise our head to look at the object).","<strong>Angle of Depression:</strong> The angle formed by the line of sight with the horizontal when the point being viewed is BELOW the horizontal level (i.e., when we lower our head to look at the object).","The angle of elevation of an object as viewed by an observer is the angle between the horizontal line and the line of sight.","If the observer moves towards the object (e.g., a tower), the angle of elevation increases.","If the observer moves away from the object, the angle of elevation decreases.","For the same height, if the distance is doubled, the angle of elevation decreases but does not become half.","The angle of depression of a point on the ground from the top of a tower is numerically equal to the angle of elevation of the top of the tower from that point on the ground (Alternate Interior Angles).","For a right-angled triangle with angle θ:","<strong>sin θ</strong> = Opposite Side / Hypotenuse","<strong>cos θ</strong> = Adjacent Side / Hypotenuse","<strong>tan θ</strong> = Opposite Side / Adjacent Side","Most problems in this chapter involve angles of 30°, 45°, and 60°. Memorize these values:","<strong>tan 30°</strong> = 1/√3 ≈ 0.577<br> <strong>tan 45°</strong> = 1<br> <strong>tan 60°</strong> = √3 ≈ 1.732","<strong>sin 30°</strong> = 1/2<br> <strong>sin 45°</strong> = 1/√2<br> <strong>sin 60°</strong> = √3/2","<strong>cos 30°</strong> = √3/2<br> <strong>cos 45°</strong> = 1/√2<br> <strong>cos 60°</strong> = 1/2","1. Read the problem carefully and draw a neat, labeled diagram. Represent the height (tower, building) by a vertical line and the distance by a horizontal line.","2. Mark the given angles of elevation or depression. Remember, angle of depression is marked with the horizontal line at the top.","3. Identify the right-angled triangle(s) formed.","4. Choose the appropriate trigonometric ratio (usually tan θ, sometimes sin θ or cos θ) that relates the known side to the unknown side.","5. Form an equation and solve for the unknown value."],

Length of diameter is twice the radius (d = 2r). <strong>Secant:</strong> A line that intersects the circle at two distinct points. <strong>Tangent:</strong> A line that intersects the circle at exactly one point. This point is called the Point of Contact.",
