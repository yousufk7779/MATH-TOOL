    title: "Real Numbers",
    introduction: "We begin our study of numbers by revisiting the system of Real Numbers. Real numbers include all the rational numbers (like 1/2, 0, -5) and irrational numbers (like √2, π) that we can represent on a number line. In this chapter, we will deepen our understanding of these numbers through two important properties: the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic and the concept of Irrationality.",
    definitions: [{"term":"Algorithm","description":"A series of well-defined steps which gives a procedure for solving a type of problem."},{"term":"Lemma","description":"A proven statement used for proving another statement."},{"term":"Prime Number","description":"A number greater than 1 with exactly two factors: 1 and itself."},{"term":"Composite Number","description":"A number that has more than two factors."},{"term":"Co-prime Numbers","description":"Two numbers whose HCF is 1."},{"term":"Rational Number","description":"Any number that can be expressed in the form p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0."},{"term":"Irrational Number","description":"A number that cannot be expressed in the form p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0 (e.g., √2, π)."}],
    keyPoints: ["Every composite number can be written as a product of primes, and this decomposition is unique.","Irrational numbers are those which cannot be written in the form p/q.","If a number has a decimal expansion that is non-terminating and non-recurring, it is irrational.","HCF is the product of the smallest power of each common prime factor.","LCM is the product of the greatest power of each prime factor."],
    formulas: [{"name":"Formula","formula":"HCF(a, b) × LCM(a, b) = a × b"},{"name":"Formula","formula":"If a prime p divides a², then p divides a."}],
    crux: ["This chapter explores the world of real numbers, focusing on integers, rational numbers, and irrational numbers. The core idea is to understand the fundamental building blocks of numbers through prime factorization and to rigorously prove why numbers like √2 and √3 cannot be expressed as simple fractions.","Two main pillars of this chapter are:","The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: Any composite number can be uniquely broken down into prime factors.","Revisiting Irrational Numbers: Using contradiction to prove a number is irrational."],
    summary: ["In this chapter, we learned that every composite number can be expressed as a product of primes in a unique way. We used this property to find the LCM and HCF of integers. We also proved that numbers like √2, √3 are irrational by assuming the opposite and finding a contradiction (that common factors exist where they shouldn't). Finally, we saw that the sum or product of a rational and irrational number is always irrational."],
