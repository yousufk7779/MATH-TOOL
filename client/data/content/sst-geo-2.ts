    title: "Forest and Wildlife Resources",
    introduction: "Did you know that India is one of the world's richest countries in terms of its vast array of biological diversity? Our planet shares life with millions of other living beings, from micro-organisms to elephants. But due to our greed, this beautiful web of life is under severe threat.",

        "India has nearly 8% of the total number of species in the world. However, many of them are on the verge of extinction due to human activities.",
        "The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) classifies species into categories: Normal, Endangered, Vulnerable, Rare, Endemic, and Extinct.",
        "Major causes of forest and wildlife depletion in India include: expansion of agriculture, large-scale development projects (like river valley projects), mining, unequal access to resources, and poaching.",
        "The destruction of forests heavily impacts marginal and tribal communities who depend directly on forest resources for food, medicine, and culture.",
        "The Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act was implemented in 1972. It created an all-India list of protected species and banned hunting/poaching.",
        "Forests in India are classified into Reserved Forests (most restricted), Protected Forests (protected from further depletion), and Unclassed Forests (belonging to government and private individuals).",
        "Community conservation is very strong in India. Movements like the 'Chipko Movement' in the Himalayas and the 'Bhairodev Dakav Sonchuri' set up by villagers in Rajasthan show how locals protect forests."
