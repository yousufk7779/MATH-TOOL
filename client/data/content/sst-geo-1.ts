    title: "Resources and Development",
    introduction: "Everything available in our environment that can be used to satisfy our needs is a resource. But wait! Is a piece of rock a resource? Only if we have the technology to use it, the money to afford it, and society's permission to use it. Let's learn how we categorize resources and how important it is to plan their development.",

        { term: "Resource", description: "Everything available in our environment that satisfies our needs, provided it is technologically accessible, economically feasible, and culturally acceptable." },
        { term: "Renewable Resources", description: "Resources that can be renewed or reproduced by physical, chemical, or mechanical processes quickly. Example: solar energy, wind energy, water, forests." },
        { term: "Non-Renewable Resources", description: "Resources that take millions of years in their formation. Once exhausted, they cannot be readily replaced. Example: coal, petroleum, minerals." },
        { term: "Sustainable Development", description: "Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Development should not damage the environment." },

    keyPoints: [
        "Resources can be classified based on origin (Biotic/Abiotic), exhaustibility (Renewable/Non-renewable), ownership (Individual/Community/National/International), and status of development (Potential/Developed/Stock/Reserve).",
        "India has diverse relief features: 43% plains (good for agriculture), 30% mountains (tourism and rivers), and 27% plateaus (rich in minerals).",
        "Land degradation is a huge problem. It is caused by deforestation, overgrazing, mining, and over-irrigation (which makes soil salty/alkaline).",
        "Alluvial soil is the most widely spread and fertile soil in India, found in the northern plains and river deltas.",
        "Black soil (Regur soil) is ideal for growing cotton. It has a high capacity to hold moisture and develops deep cracks during hot weather.",
        "Laterite soil develops in areas with high temperature and heavy rainfall. It is poor in humus but good for growing tea, coffee, and cashew nuts if properly fertilized.",
        "Soil erosion (gully erosion and sheet erosion) can be prevented by contour ploughing, terrace farming, and planting shelter belts of trees."

        "Due to irrational consumption and over-utilization of resources, the world faces severe ecological crises like global warming and land degradation.",
        "Resource planning is essential because resources are unevenly distributed (e.g., Rajasthan has solar energy but lacks water).",
        "India is blessed with diverse geographies and soil types. Understanding soils helps us choose the right crops and conservation methods."

                        "3. Strip cropping: Large fields can be divided into strips. Strips of grass are left to grow between the crops to break the force of the wind."
