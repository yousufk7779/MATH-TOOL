    title: "The Making of a Global World",
    introduction: "You might think 'Globalization' is a modern concept with the internet and airplanes. But it's actually centuries old! Before modern transport, people, goods, money, and even diseases traveled across the world, connecting different continents. Let's see how the world became 'global'.",

        { term: "Globalization", description: "The process of rapid integration or interconnection between different countries through trade, capital, and migration of people." },
        { term: "Silk Routes", description: "Ancient network of trade routes connecting Asia with Europe and Northern Africa. They carried Chinese silk, Indian spices, and ideas across the world." },
        { term: "Indentured Labour", description: "A system of bonded labour under contract. A worker agrees to work for a specific employer for a specific time, usually to pay off a transport loan to a new country (like Indians going to Fiji or Caribbean)." },

    keyPoints: [
        "Long before Columbus discovered America, the Silk Routes were vibrant connecting points for trade and culture. Even Buddhism traveled through these routes!",
        "Food travelled too! Potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, and maize were introduced to Europe and Asia ONLY after Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas.",
        "When the Spanish conquered America, their most powerful weapon was not guns, but a disease: Smallpox. Native Americans had no immunity to it, so it wiped out entire populations easily.",
        "In the 19th Century, industrialization in Europe led to a massive demand for food and raw materials. Millions of Europeans migrated to America and Australia to set up farms.",
        "Technology, especially the steamship, railway, and the telegraph, drastically accelerated globalization. For example, refrigerated ships allowed cheap meat from America/Australia to be sold in Europe.",
        "The dark side of this trade was Colonialism in Africa. European powers drew arbitrary lines on the map of Africa and divided it among themselves.",
        "Rinderpest (Cattle Plague) arrived in Africa in the late 1880s, destroying 90% of African cattle. This forced the native Africans, who previously survived on cattle, into European labour markets.",
        "After World War II, the Bretton Woods conference set up the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and World Bank to help rebuild the global economy and provide financial stability."
