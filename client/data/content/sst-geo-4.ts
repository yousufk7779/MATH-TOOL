    introduction: "India is an agriculturally important country. Two-thirds of its population is engaged in agricultural activities. It is a primary activity, which produces most of the food we consume and also provides raw materials for many industries.",

        { term: "Primitive Subsistence Farming", description: "Farming practiced on small patches of land with the help of primitive tools. It depends upon monsoon, natural fertility of the soil, and environmental conditions (e.g., Jhumming)." },
        { term: "Intensive Subsistence Farming", description: "Farming practiced in areas of high population pressure on land. It is labour-intensive farming, where high doses of biochemical inputs and irrigation are used for obtaining higher production." },

    keyPoints: [
        "India has three cropping seasons: Rabi (sown in winter, harvested in summer), Kharif (sown with monsoon, harvested in autumn), and Zaid (in between Rabi and Kharif).",
        "Rice is a Kharif crop which requires high temperature (above 25°C) and high humidity with annual rainfall above 100 cm. India is the second-largest producer of rice.",
        "Wheat is the main food crop in north and north-western India. It is a Rabi crop that requires a cool growing season and bright sunshine at the time of ripening.",
        "Millets (Jowar, Bajra, and Ragi) are harsh crops known as coarse grains, but they have very high nutritional value. Ragi is very rich in iron and calcium.",
        "India is the largest producer as well as the consumer of pulses in the world. Pulses are the major source of protein in a vegetarian diet.",
        "Bhoodan-Gramdan movement, initiated by Vinoba Bhave, is known as the Bloodless Revolution. It involved wealthy landowners donating land to landless peasants."
