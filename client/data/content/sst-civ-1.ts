    title: "Power Sharing",
    introduction: "Normally, sharing power might sound like giving up your strength. But in a democracy, sharing power actually makes the country stronger! Let's look at two completely different countries, Belgium and Sri Lanka, and see how their different approaches to 'sharing power' led to entirely different outcomes.",

        { term: "Majoritarianism", description: "A belief that the majority community should be able to rule a country in whichever way it wants, completely disregarding the wishes and needs of the minority." },
        { term: "Ethnic", description: "A social division based on shared culture. People belonging to the same ethnic group believe in their common descent because of similarities of physical type or culture." },
        { term: "Prudential", description: "Based on careful calculation of gains and losses. Prudential decisions in politics reduce the chances of conflict and violence." },
        { term: "Moral", description: "Based on purely ethical considerations. The moral reason for power-sharing is that it is the very spirit of democracy." },
        { term: "Checks and Balances", description: "A system in which each organ of the government checks the others (e.g., Legislature, Executive, and Judiciary) so that no organ can exercise unlimited power." }

    keyPoints: [
        "Sri Lanka (a diverse island nation) chose the path of Majoritarianism. The government forcefully favored the Sinhala majority (74%) over the Tamil minority (18%). This led to a brutal Civil War.",
        "Belgium (a small European country) faced a similar problem between Dutch-speaking (59%) and French-speaking (40%) communities.",
        "Instead of fighting, Belgium's leaders amended their constitution four times to create an innovative model of Power Sharing. Both communities got equal ministers at the center, preventing conflict.",
        "Power Sharing is desirable for two reasons: Prudential (it prevents violence and political instability) and Moral (democracy literally means rule by the people, so all people must share power).",
        "Horizontal Power Sharing: Power is shared among different organs of government like the legislature, executive, and judiciary. It ensures checks and balances.",
        "Vertical Power Sharing: Power is shared among governments at different levels (like the Central Government, State Governments, and local Panchayats)."

        "Sri Lanka didn't share power with Tamils = Civil War.",
        "Belgium shared power equally between Dutch & French = Peace.",
        "Power sharing stops violence between different groups.",
        "Power can be shared Horizontally (Legislature, Executive, Judiciary) or Vertically (Center, State, Local)."

    summary: [
        "Democracy does not mean the absolute rule of the majority; true democracy requires accommodating minorities and power sharing.",

        "Belgium's brilliant power-sharing model successfully accommodated all its linguistic differences, leading to peace and prosperity.",
        "Power-sharing is the very spirit of democracy. It reduces conflict (prudential reason) and is morally the right way to govern a diverse society."

                    solution: [
                        "1. Horizontal Power Sharing: Power is shared among different organs of government, such as the legislature, executive, and judiciary. Example: In India, the Parliament (Legislature) makes laws, the Ministers (Executive) implement them, and the Supreme Court (Judiciary) checks their legality.",

                        "3. Power sharing among social groups: Power is shared among different religious or linguistic groups. Example: The 'Community Government' in Belgium.",
                        "4. Power sharing among political parties and pressure groups: In a democracy, different political parties compete for power. Sometimes, two or more parties form an alliance to contest elections. If they win, they form a coalition government and share power."
                    ],
                    answer: "Horizontal (Legislature, Executive, Judiciary), Vertical (Central, State, Local levels), among social groups (Belgium's community govt), and among political parties (coalition governments)."

                        "Prudential Reason: Power sharing is good because it firmly helps to reduce the possibility of conflict between social groups. In India, reserving seats in the Parliament for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) ensures they are represented, preventing anger and political instability.",
                        "Moral Reason: Power sharing is the very spirit of democracy. A democratic rule genuinely involves sharing power with those profoundly affected by its exercise. In India, local self-government (Panchayats) gives power directly to the village people, fulfilling this moral obligation."

                    answer: "Prudential: Reduces conflict (e.g., reserving seats for SC/STs in India). Moral: It is the spirit of democracy (e.g., giving power to village Panchayats)."
