    title: "Gender, Religion and Caste",
    introduction: "In a democracy, everyone is equal. But does this equality exist in our daily lives? We often see people divided by their gender, religion, or the caste they are born into. Let's see how these dangerous social divisions affect our democratic politics.",

        { term: "Patriarchy", description: "A system that values men more and gives them power over women. It is a society ruled by men." },
        { term: "Feminist", description: "A woman or a man who strongly believes in equal rights and opportunities for women and men." },
        { term: "Secular State", description: "A state that does not have any official religion and completely prohibits discrimination on the grounds of religion." },

    keyPoints: [
        "Gender division is not biological but based on social expectations. The 'sexual division of labour' forces women to do all household chores while men work outside.",

        "Women's political representation in India is very low. However, 1/3rd of seats are reserved for women in local government bodies (Panchayats).",
        "Communalism happens when religion is expressed loudly in politics, and one religion tries to brutally dominate another. It is a major threat to democracy.",
        "To counter communalism, India chose to be a Secular State. The Constitution gives everyone the freedom to practice any religion.",
        "Caste is unique to India. In earlier times, your caste decided your profession and you couldn't change it.",
        "While the old caste system is slowly breaking down due to education and city life, caste is still deeply rooted in Indian politics (vote banks)."
