    title: "Manufacturing Industries",
    introduction: "Production of goods in large quantities after processing from raw materials to more valuable products is called manufacturing. Whether it's paper made from wood or iron from iron ore, manufacturing sectors form the backbone of a developing economy.",
    definitions: [
        { term: "Manufacturing", description: "The systematic processing of raw materials into more valuable goods in large quantities using machinery. (e.g. converting sugarcane to sugar)." },
        { term: "Agro-based Industries", description: "Industries that depend heavily on agricultural raw materials to produce their goods. Examples: cotton textiles, jute, silk, sugar, and edible oil." },
        { term: "Mineral-based Industries", description: "Industries that use minerals and metals as raw materials. Examples: iron and steel, cement, aluminum smelting, machine tools." },
        { term: "Basic Industries", description: "Industries that supply their products as raw materials to manufacture other goods. E.g., iron and steel industry processing iron for machinery." },
        { term: "Consumer Industries", description: "Industries that produce goods directly for consumption by consumers. E.g., sugar, toothpaste, paper, sewing machines." },
        { term: "Joint Sector Industries", description: "Industries which are jointly run by the state and individuals or a group of individuals (e.g., Oil India Ltd)." }

    keyPoints: [
        "Manufacturing is considered the backbone of economic development as it reduces dependence on agriculture, creates jobs, brings in foreign exchange, and eradicates poverty.",
        "Industrial locations are complex. They are influenced by the availability of raw materials, cheap labour, capital, power, and market demand.",
        "The textile industry is the only industry in the country which is self-reliant and complete in its value chain (from raw material to highest-value garments). It contributes significantly to industrial production, employment generation, and foreign exchange.",
        "The jute industry is mostly concentrated in West Bengal (along the banks of the Hugli river) due to proximity to jute-producing areas, abundant water, and cheap labor.",
        "The iron and steel industry is heavily concentrated in the Chotanagpur plateau region because of the low cost of iron ore, high-grade raw materials, cheap labour, and vast growth potential.",
        "The IT and Electronics industry in India (Silicon Valley: Bengaluru) has been a major success, providing massive employment and creating huge foreign exchange reserves."

    summary: [
        "Manufacturing industries are the very heart of an industrialized nation's economy.",
        "They are broadly divided into agro-based, mineral-based, basic, and consumer industries.",
        "The choice of an industrial location is determined by factors like raw material proximity, water, labour, transport, and supportive government policies.",
        "While industries speed up economic growth and create massive employment, they are also responsible for severe environmental degradation: air, water, and noise pollution.",
        "Future industrialization must adopt eco-friendly measures to ensure sustainable development."
