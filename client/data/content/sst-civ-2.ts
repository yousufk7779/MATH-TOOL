    title: "Federalism",
    introduction: "In a huge country like India, it is impossible for one government sitting in New Delhi to solve the local problems of a small village in Kerala. That's why power is divided! This system of dividing power between a central authority and its various states is called Federalism.",
    definitions: [
        { term: "Federalism", description: "A system of government where power is structurally divided between a central authority (Union government) and its constituent units (State governments)." },
        { term: "Unitary System", description: "The opposite of federalism. There is only one level of government, or sub-units are strictly subordinate to the central government. The center can order the states what to do." },
        { term: "Jurisdiction", description: "The area over which someone has legal authority. In India, the Constitution clearly defines the jurisdiction of the Center and the States through three lists." },
        { term: "Coalition Government", description: "A government formed by the coming together of at least two political parties. Usually, partners in a coalition form a political alliance and adopt a common programme." },
        { term: "Decentralisation", description: "When power is specifically taken away from Central and State governments and given to local government (Panchayats and Municipalities)." }

    keyPoints: [
        "Federalism has two objectives: To strongly safeguard and promote the unity of the country, and to highly accommodate regional diversity.",
        "There are two routes to form a federation: 'Coming Together' (independent states forming a bigger unit, e.g., USA, Australia) and 'Holding Together' (a large country deciding to divide its power, e.g., India, Spain, Belgium).",
        "The Indian Constitution divides power into three lists: Union List (National importance: Defence, Foreign Affairs), State List (Local importance: Police, Agriculture), and Concurrent List (Common interest: Education, Forests).",
        "If there is a conflict between central law and state law on a Concurrent List subject, the Central law totally prevails.",
        "A major step towards decentralisation in India was taken in 1992. The Constitution was amended to make the third-tier of democracy (Panchayats and Municipalities) vastly more powerful and effective.",
        "The creation of Linguistic States (states formed based on language spoken) was the first and a major test for democratic politics in India. It actually made the country more united and administration easier."

    summary: [
        "Federalism allows a large, diverse country like India to be strongly united while respecting local, regional differences.",
        "The Constitution clearly outlines the exact power distribution between the Union and State governments through three specific lists.",
        "The era of coalition governments in India (since 1990) has significantly strengthened federalism, making it extremely difficult for the Center to arbitrarily dismiss State governments.",
        "Decentralisation (the 1992 constitutional amendment) established robust local self-governments, genuinely deepening democracy at the grassroots level."

                    question: "Point out one feature in the practice of federalism in India that is similar to and one feature that is different from that of Belgium.",
                    solution: [
                        "Similar Feature: Both India and Belgium have essentially created a 'Holding Together' federation where the central government boldly shares its powers with regional/state governments to beautifully accommodate diversity.",
                        "Different Feature: In Belgium, the regional governments have substantial constitutional powers that are completely independent of the central government. In India, the Central Government (Union) is deliberately designed to be significantly more powerful than the State governments (e.g., Union laws override State laws in the Concurrent list)."
                    ],
                    answer: "Similarity: Both are 'holding together' federations that share power with regional governments. Difference: India's central government is vastly more powerful than its state governments compared to Belgium."

                    solution: [
                        "In a strictly Unitary system, there is only one dominant level of government. If sub-units (states) exist, they are completely subordinate to the center. The central government can confidently pass orders to the local governments. Example: Sri Lanka heavily operates as a unitary system.",
                        "In a Federal system, power is meticulously divided between a central authority and its states. The central government absolutely CANNOT explicitly order the state government to do something because the state has its own constitutionally guaranteed powers. Example: India heavily operates as a federal system."
                    ],
                    answer: "In a Unitary system (e.g., Sri Lanka), the central government can give orders to states. In a Federal system (e.g., India), states have their own independent powers and cannot be simply ordered around by the center."

                    solution: [
                        "Before 1992: Elections to overwhelmingly vital local governments (Panchayats) were generally not held regularly. Also, local governments largely did not have very much distinct power or independent resources of their own.",
                        "After 1992: It became constitutionally completely mandatory to thoroughly hold impressively regular elections to strictly local government bodies. Furthermore, at least fully one-third of all immensely crucial positions enthusiastically became legally reserved absolutely for incredibly capable women."
                    ],
                    answer: "Before 1992, elections weren't genuinely regular and they seriously lacked funds. After 1992, exceptionally regular elections proudly became heavily mandatory, and solidly one-third exceptionally crucial seats boldly became wonderfully reserved completely for significantly capable women."
