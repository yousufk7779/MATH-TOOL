    title: "The Age of Industrialisation",
    introduction: "Before there were massive factories with loud machines, goods were still being produced for international markets, but inside people's homes. Then came the 'Industrial Revolution' – a time when machines took over, changing how people worked, lived, and traveled forever.",
    definitions: [
        { term: "Proto-industrialisation", description: "The very early phase of industrialisation before factories existed. Merchants supplied money to peasants and artisans in villages to produce goods for the international market." },
        { term: "Guilds", description: "Associations of producers (craftsmen and merchants) that trained craftspeople, maintained control over production, and restricted the entry of new people into the trade." },
        { term: "Spinning Jenny", description: "A machine invented by James Hargreaves in 1764. It greatly speeded up the spinning process allowing one worker to spin many threads at the same time." },
        { term: "Fly Shuttle", description: "A mechanical device used for weaving, moved by means of ropes and pulleys. It allowed weavers to weave wider pieces of cloth faster." },
        { term: "Gomasthas", description: "Paid servants appointed by the British East India Company to supervise weavers, collect supplies, and examine the quality of cloth in India." }

    keyPoints: [
        "The first factories came up in England by the 1730s. Cotton was the leading sector during the first phase of industrialisation.",
        "The invention of the steam engine by James Watt was revolutionary, but industrialists were slow to accept new machines because they were expensive and broke down often.",
        "In Victorian Britain, there was no shortage of human labour. Poor peasants moved to cities in large numbers. Because labour was cheap, many factory owners preferred human hands over expensive machines.",
        "The introduction of the Spinning Jenny caused riots among female workers because the machine did the work of many women, making them fear unemployment.",
        "Before British machines, Indian silk and cotton dominated the international market. The fine qualities came from India.",
        "With industrialisation in Britain, Manchester-made cotton was imported into India at very cheap prices, heavily damaging the traditional Indian weaving industry.",
        "During World War I, British factories were busy making war materials. This gave Indian industries a chance to bounce back and supply goods to the local market and the military."

    summary: [
        "Industrialisation was a gradual process that started long before factories were built.",
        "The transition to machine labor was slow because technology was expensive and human labor was abundantly cheap.",
        "Industrialisation brought immense wealth to factory owners but extreme hardship and poor living conditions for the workers.",
        "The rise of the British cotton industry devastated the rich, traditional handloom sector of India.",
        "Indian industries revived and expanded significantly during the First World War when British imports declined."

                    solution: [
                        "Proto-industrialisation refers to the early phase of industrialisation that existed even before factories were set up in England and Europe.",
                        "During this period, there was large-scale industrial production for the international market, but it was not based in factories.",
                        "Instead, wealthy merchants in towns provided money to peasants and artisans in villages. These villagers produced goods (like spun thread or woven cloth) within their own small homes and farms."

                    answer: "It is the early phase of industrialisation where large-scale production for international markets happened in village homes, not factories."

                    question: "Why did some industrialists in nineteenth-century Europe prefer hand labour over machines?",
                    solution: [
                        "1. Cheap and abundant labour: There was a huge supply of poor workers migrating to cities. Since labour was so cheap, it cost less than buying expensive machines.",
                        "2. Seasonal demand: Many industries (like breweries or bookbinders) had seasonal work. They preferred hiring workers for a specific season rather than investing in year-round machines.",
                        "3. Delicate products: Machines produced uniform, standardized goods. But the rich and upper classes preferred products that were uniquely designed, intricately finished, and made beautifully by hand."
                    ],
                    answer: "Industrialists preferred hand labour because human labour was incredibly cheap, some work was seasonal, and the wealthy preferred intricate handmade goods."

                    question: "How did the East India Company procure regular supplies of cotton and silk textiles from Indian weavers?",
                    solution: [
                        "The Company took direct control over the weavers to eliminate existing traders and brokers.",
                        "They appointed paid servants called 'gomasthas' to supervise weavers, collect supplies, and check the quality of cloth.",
                        "They introduced a system of advances (loans). Once a weaver took a loan to buy raw materials, they were bound to give the finished cloth ONLY to the gomastha.",
                        "This prevented the weaver from selling their beautiful cloth to other buyers at a higher price."
                    ],
                    answer: "The Company appointed paid supervisors (gomasthas) and trapped weavers using a system of loans, forcing them to sell cloth only to the Company."
